## ✅ Final Outcome

- The **Control Campaign** was found to be more **cost-effective** and delivered **higher reach**.
- Despite more clicks and purchases in the **Test Campaign**, the **Control Campaign had a lower cost per purchase**, resulting in **better ROI**.
- Thus, the **Control Campaign** is the **recommended choice** for future digital marketing strategies based on data-driven insights.
